# Self introduction

Hello, I am Frank from HK PolyU BME.

My researchs include wavefront shaping & aritificial intelligence.

> _Face recognition has become ubiquitous for authentication or security purposes. 
> Meanwhile, there are increasing concerns about the privacy of face images, which are 
> sensitive biometric data and should be protected. Software-based cryptosystems are 
> widely adopted to encrypt face images, but the security level is limited by insufficient 
> digital secret key length or computing power. Hardware-based optical cryptosystems can 
> generate enormously longer secret keys and enable encryption at light speed, but most 
> reported optical methods, such as double random phase encryption, are less compatible 
> with other systems due to system complexity. In this study, a plain yet highly efficient 
> speckle-based optical cryptosystem is proposed and implemented. A scattering ground glass 
> is exploited to generate physical secret keys of 17.2 gigabit length and encrypt face images 
> via seemingly random optical speckles at light speed. Face images can then be decrypted from 
> random speckles by a well-trained decryption neural network, such that face recognition can 
> be realized with up to 98% accuracy. Furthermore, attack analyses are carried out to show 
> the cryptosystem's security. Due to its high security, fast speed, and low cost, the 
> speckle-based optical cryptosystem is suitable for practical applications and can inspire 
> other high-security cryptosystems._

> _Optical techniques offer a wide variety of applications as light-matter interactions 
> provide extremely sensitive mechanisms to probe or treat target media. Most of these 
> implementations rely on the usage of ballistic or quasi-ballistic photons to achieve 
> high spatial resolution. However, the inherent scattering nature of light in biological 
> tissues or tissue-like scattering media constitutes a critical obstacle that has restricted 
> the penetration depth of non-scattered photons and hence limited the implementation of most 
> optical techniques for wider applications. In addition, the components of an optical system 
> are usually designed and manufactured for a fixed function or performance. Recent advances 
> in wavefront shaping have demonstrated that scattering- or component-induced phase distortions 
> can be compensated by optimizing the wavefront of the input light pattern through iteration or 
> by conjugating the transmission matrix of the scattering medium. This offers unprecedented 
> opportunities in many applications to achieve controllable optical delivery or detection at 
> depths or dynamically configurable functionalities by using scattering media to substitute 
> conventional optical components. In this article, the recent progress of wavefront shaping 
> in multidisciplinary fields is reviewed, from optical focusing and imaging with scattering 
> media, functionalized devices, modulation of mode coupling, and nonlinearity in multimode 
> fiber to multimode fiber-based applications. Apart from insights into the underlying 
> principles and recent advances in wavefront shaping implementations, practical limitations 
> and roadmap for future development are discussed in depth. Looking back and looking forward, 
> it is believed that wavefront shaping holds a bright future that will open new avenues for 
> noninvasive or minimally invasive optical interactions and arbitrary control inside deep 
> tissues. The high degree of freedom with multiple scattering will also provide unprecedented 
> opportunities to develop novel optical devices based on a single scattering medium (generic 
> or customized) that can outperform traditional optical components._
