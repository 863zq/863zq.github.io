> _Optical focusing through scattering media has a significant impact on optical applications 
> in biological tissues. Recently, iterative wavefront shaping (WFS) has been successfully used 
> to focus light through or inside scattering media, and various heuristic algorithms have been 
> introduced to improve the performance. While these results are encouraging, more efforts are 
> needed to tune parameters towards robust and optimum optimization. Moreover, optimal parameters 
> might differ for different scattering samples and experimental conditions. In this Letter, we 
> propose a “smart” parameter-free algorithm by combining a traditional genetic algorithm with a 
> bat algorithm, and the mutation rate can be automatically calculated through real-time feedback. 
> Using this method in iterative WFS, one can achieve robust and optimum performance without a 
> parameter tuning process._
