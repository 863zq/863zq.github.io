> _Face recognition has been widely implemented in public places for security purposes. 
> However, face photos are sensitive biometric data, and their privacy is a common concern, 
> which often needs to be protected via cryptosystems. Popular software-based cryptosystems 
> have limitations on short secret key lengths, posing a significant threat when facing high 
> performance quantum computing. Recently, in order to achieve higher level security, 
> hardware-based optical cryptosystems have been investigated. However, due to the complexity 
> of optical system designs, it is difficult to integrate the extensively studied optical double 
> random phase encryption into current face recognition systems. Speckle-based cryptosystems, 
> on the contrary, affords high-level safety with high adaptivity, high speed, and low cost, 
> using simpler optical setups. In this study, a speckle-based optical cryptosystem for face 
> recognition is proposed, and encrypted face recognition is experimentally demonstrated. 
> During encryption, a scattering ground glass is utilized as the only physical secret key 
> with 17.2 gigabit length, so as to encrypt face images via random optical speckles at 
> light speed. During decryption, a specially designed neural network is pre-trained to 
> reconstruct face images from speckles with high fidelity, allowing for up to 98% accuracy 
> in the subsequent face recognition process. Apart from face recognition, the proposed 
> speckle-based optical cryptosystem can also be transferred to other high-security 
> cryptosystems due to its high security, high adaptivity, fast speed, and low cost._
