> _Face recognition has become ubiquitous for authentication or security purposes. 
> Meanwhile, there are increasing concerns about the privacy of face images, which are 
> sensitive biometric data and should be protected. Software-based cryptosystems are 
> widely adopted to encrypt face images, but the security level is limited by insufficient 
> digital secret key length or computing power. Hardware-based optical cryptosystems can 
> generate enormously longer secret keys and enable encryption at light speed, but most 
> reported optical methods, such as double random phase encryption, are less compatible 
> with other systems due to system complexity. In this study, a plain yet highly efficient 
> speckle-based optical cryptosystem is proposed and implemented. A scattering ground glass 
> is exploited to generate physical secret keys of 17.2 gigabit length and encrypt face images 
> via seemingly random optical speckles at light speed. Face images can then be decrypted from 
> random speckles by a well-trained decryption neural network, such that face recognition can 
> be realized with up to 98% accuracy. Furthermore, attack analyses are carried out to show 
> the cryptosystem's security. Due to its high security, fast speed, and low cost, the 
> speckle-based optical cryptosystem is suitable for practical applications and can inspire 
> other high-security cryptosystems._
