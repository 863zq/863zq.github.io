> _Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-known iterative algorithm commonly adopted in wavefront shaping 
> for focusing light through or inside scattering media. The performance is, however, limited by premature convergence 
> in an unstable environment. Therefore, we aim to solve this problem and enhance the focusing performance by adding a 
> dynamic mutation operation into the plain PSO. With dynamic mutation, the “particles,” or the optimized masks, are 
> mutated with quantifiable discrepancy between the current and theoretical optimal solution, i.e., the “error rate.” 
> Gauged by that, the diversity of the “particles” is effectively expanded, and the adaptability of the algorithm to 
> noise and instability is significantly promoted, yielding optimization approaching the theoretical optimum. The 
> simulation and experimental results show that PSO with dynamic mutation demonstrates considerably better performance 
> than PSO without mutation or with a constant mutation, especially under a noisy environment._
