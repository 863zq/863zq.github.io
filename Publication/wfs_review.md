**Abstract:** Optical techniques offer a wide variety of applications as light-matter interactions 
provide extremely sensitive mechanisms to probe or treat target media. Most of these 
implementations rely on the usage of ballistic or quasi-ballistic photons to achieve 
high spatial resolution. However, the inherent scattering nature of light in biological 
tissues or tissue-like scattering media constitutes a critical obstacle that has restricted 
the penetration depth of non-scattered photons and hence limited the implementation of most 
optical techniques for wider applications. In addition, the components of an optical system 
are usually designed and manufactured for a fixed function or performance. Recent advances 
in wavefront shaping have demonstrated that scattering- or component-induced phase distortions 
can be compensated by optimizing the wavefront of the input light pattern through iteration or 
by conjugating the transmission matrix of the scattering medium. This offers unprecedented 
opportunities in many applications to achieve controllable optical delivery or detection at 
depths or dynamically configurable functionalities by using scattering media to substitute 
conventional optical components. In this article, the recent progress of wavefront shaping 
in multidisciplinary fields is reviewed, from optical focusing and imaging with scattering 
media, functionalized devices, modulation of mode coupling, and nonlinearity in multimode 
fiber to multimode fiber-based applications. Apart from insights into the underlying 
principles and recent advances in wavefront shaping implementations, practical limitations 
and roadmap for future development are discussed in depth. Looking back and looking forward, 
it is believed that wavefront shaping holds a bright future that will open new avenues for 
noninvasive or minimally invasive optical interactions and arbitrary control inside deep 
tissues. The high degree of freedom with multiple scattering will also provide unprecedented 
opportunities to develop novel optical devices based on a single scattering medium (generic 
or customized) that can outperform traditional optical components.
