> _In this work, we proposed a parameter-free algorithm (PFA) for iterative wavefront shaping,
> in which the time-consuming parameter tuning process is not required. The simulation and
> experiment results show that PFA can achieve better performance than GA and BA, without
> a parameter tuning process. Furthermore, since the mutation rate in PFA is inherited from
> the dynamic mutation algorithm, which has demonstrated high adaptability against perturbations,
> the robustness of PFA is satisfactory. In the future, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based
> system can be implemented to accelerate iterative wavefront shaping and achieve real-time optical
> focusing in dynamic scattering media, such as biological tissue._
