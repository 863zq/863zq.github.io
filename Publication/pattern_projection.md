**Abstract:** Focusing light into an arbitrary pattern through complex media is desired in energy delivery-related
scenarios and has been demonstrated feasible with the assistance of wavefront shaping. However, it
still encounters challenges in terms of pattern fidelity and focusing contrast, especially in a
noisy and perturbed environment. In this work, we show that the strategy relying on natural gradient
ascent-based parameter optimization can help to resist noise and disturbance, enabling rapid wavefront
optimization towards high-quality pattern projection through complex media. It is revealed that faster
convergence and better robustness can be achieved compared with existing phase control algorithms.
Meanwhile, a new fitness function based on cosine similarity is adopted for the algorithm, leading
to higher focusing contrast without sacrificing similarity to the target pattern. As a result,
long-distance projection of an arbitrary pattern can be accomplished with considerably enhanced
performance through a 15-meter multimode fiber that is not fixed and susceptible to perturbation.
With further engineering, the approach may find special interests for many biomedical applications,
such as deep-tissue photon therapy and optogenetics, where free-space localized optical delivery
encounters challenges.
