> _Environmental sensing is an important task in the development of infrastructures for the 
> applications of the Internet of things. In this work, we introduce a flexible humidity sensor 
> based on electrochemically polymerized polypyrrole to absorb or desorb water vapors to detect 
> relative humidity (RH). A test platform was built to mix the different amounts of dry and wet 
> air for the relative humidity ranging from 15% to 95%. Experimental results show that the response 
> time from 20% to 90% RH of the sensor was 505 seconds and the recovery time from 90% to 20% RH was 
> 328 seconds with good repeatability during three cycles. The wide dynamic range, excellent repeatability 
> and reasonable response time make the sensor applicable for home monitoring applications. Furthermore, 
> the flexible sensor is suitable for embedding into wallpaper or decorations for promising future systems 
> to map the environmental status of buildings and homes._
