**Abstract:** In the era of digits and internet, massive data have been continuously generated from a variety 
of sources, including video, photo, audio, text, internet of things, etc. It is intuitive that more accurate 
patterns can be obtained by feeding more data for effective analysis; despite the data redundancy, a clearer 
picture can be delineated for better decision-making. However, traditional methods, even in machine learning, 
do not benefit from the expanding amount of data, whose performance nearly saturates when the data collection 
is large enough (Figure 1A). Such a dilemma emerges due to their limited capability and insufficient supply 
of computation power in the past.

Various accelerators have been developed to improve DNN computation regarding processing speed as well as 
energy efficiency. An overall tendency of the computation platforms has been seen, evolving from conventional 
electronics to physical systems, with progressive reductions in energy consumption. While there are limitations 
for current realizations of physical systems, vigorous development is strongly looked forward to to continuously 
improve energy efficiency with the desired performance.
